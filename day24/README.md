In this section, we continue to `RBAC` in `kubernetes`, `clusterrole` and `clusterrole-binding` will be explained.

Resources such as `namespace` and `node` are cluster-scoped.

Cluster-scoped resources are Kubernetes resources that are not namespaced. Cluster-scoped resources may be part of the Kubernetes cluster configuration or may be part of one or more applications.[source](https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/clusterscoped.html#cluster-scoped-resources)

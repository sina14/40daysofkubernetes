This section is about `cronjob`, `job` and `daemonset`.
As the definition, `DaemonSets` are `Kubernetes` API objects that allow you to run `Pods` as a `daemon` on each of your `Nodes`. New Nodes that join the `cluster` will automatically start running `Pods` that are part of a `DaemonSet`.

`DaemonSets` are often used to run long-lived background services such as Node monitoring systems and log collection agents. To ensure complete coverage, itâ€™s important that these apps run a `Pod` on every Node in your `cluster`. [source](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-daemonset#what-is-a-kubernetes-daemonset)

#### 1. Create a `daemonset`:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1

kind:  DaemonSet

metadata:
  name: nginx-ds
  labels:
    env: demo

spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        env: demo
      name: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      env: demo
```

```console
root@localhost:~# kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
daemonset.apps/nginx-ds created
root@localhost:~# kubectl get po
